subScan: Scans the subnet for devices that are active or have been recently
active. Attempts to create a socket by using gethostbyaddr(ip_address). Prints
out IP addresses and device name to console. Works for class C and class B 
addresses. 
Ex: python subScan.py -H 192.168.10.1 -S 255.255.255.0
Ex: python subnetScan.py -H 192.168.1.1 -S 255.255.255.0 | cut -d ' ' -f 1 > addresses.txt

portScanner: Takes in a list of IP addresses from a file and port numbers and
attempts a SYN scan on each port for every IP address. Results are printed to
console. 
Ex: python portScanner.py -F addresses.txt -P 20,22,80,443
